========================================
  MAKE SAIYARA PLAY ON THE PAGE
========================================

The song didn't play because the audio file is not in the repo yet.

TO FIX (so the song plays on the page):

1. Get the Saiyara song as an MP3 file (from your music app, CD, or a source you're allowed to use).

2. Rename the file to exactly:  saiyara.mp3

3. Put saiyara.mp3 in THIS folder (same folder as index.html):
   C:\Users\bhavi\Downloads\take-me-out-page\

4. Push to GitHub:
   Open PowerShell and run:

   cd "C:\Users\bhavi\Downloads\take-me-out-page"
   git add saiyara.mp3
   git commit -m "Add Saiyara audio"
   git push origin main

5. Wait 1–2 minutes for GitHub Pages to update. Then open your page again — when you click No on the first question, the song will play on the page.

========================================

Until you add saiyara.mp3: when you click No, Spotify will open in a new tab so you can still listen to Saiyara there.
