When Deepu clicks "No" on the 1st question:
• Spotify opens in a NEW TAB (or Spotify app)
• The letter page STAYS OPEN in the first tab
• He taps Saiyara in Spotify to play
• He switches back to the browser tab with your letter
• He clicks "Yes" when he's ready → next question

No need to close Spotify — just switch tabs and click Yes.
